# Bot Extensions

###### A repository of extensions that can be used in my drag and drop discord bots.

## How do I add one of the extensions?

Each extension has their own `README`, if any special installation is required it will be stated there.

## Its not working/giving an error

First check if you have the latest version of the bot. If you are on the latest version
please [create an issue](https://github.com/Arthurdw/Reaction-Role/issues/new)
or join [our discord](https://discord.gg/Z6dw5pw) and I'll help you out!

## Applicable bots:
